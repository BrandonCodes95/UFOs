# UFOs

## Purpose 

  The purpose of this project was to help create a website that displayed a article and data pretaining to UFO sightings. Also allowing the user to customize their search from the data on the website to quickly find sightings relevant to them. All of this was accomplished using Javascript and HTML. 
  
 ## Results 
 
  The result is a nicely displayed webpage with the title and text displayed in a very readbale format.

  To navigate and use the site to its full abilities, all someone has to do is enter their search criteria into the search filters. All of the criteria do not have to be filled out in order for results to populate. All of just one can be used. 
  
  The filters are case sensative which is important to keep in mind for the user. In the example below you can see we have filtered out the results for just the state of NJ.

  ## Summary 
  
  One drawback of this current design of the website is that the text are case sensative and it would be more user friendly to have it accept all text that match. Other reccomendations would be to allow the site to webscrape from other sites to pull articles and data to update the information. Currently all data must be manually changed. Another suggestion would be to clean the page up some and not have all of the data showing at once making the home page very long and data heavy.
